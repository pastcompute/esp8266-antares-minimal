This is a clone of [https://github.com/nekromant/esp8266-frankenstein](esp8266-frankenstein) with all the user code removed except that which allows it to link and print a hello world message.

The purpose of this was to experiment with frankenstein and to learn about how to use antares, and now to serve as a base for another esp8266 project I am working on where I dont require a console or all the associated features.
