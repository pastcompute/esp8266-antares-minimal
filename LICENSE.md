# License information

This codebase is comprised of code from different sources.

Thus individual files are licensed as marked.

Given the information below, any derived work is likely to be
of a GPL form license unless it is a modification to the lwip
component in which case that part of the code is a BSD-style license.

Components identified include:

## lwip 

lwip is Copyright (c) 2001-2004 Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
lwip uses a kind of BSDish license

## various other code from esp8266-frankenstein

* pin_map.c, helpers.c, etc.
* kcnf, Makefile, etc

These are derived from esp8266-frankenstein and are thus GPL2

## various code from Espressif

Some code derived from esp8266-frankenstein is derived from the ESP8266 SDK
and is marked Copyright 2013-2014 Espressif Systems (Wuxi)
